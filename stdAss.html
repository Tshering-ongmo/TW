            Student Association
        </h2>
        <p>Education goes well beyond academic coursework. Extracurricular activities can form a vital part of a studentâ€™s experience here at Sherubtse, creating unique opportunities for friendship and learning. Student activities complement their academic studies.</p>
        <p>The College has several student organizations formed with the noble objective to provide platforms for the wholesome development of students. All students are eligible to become a member of any of the clubs, units, societies and forums. These are purely co-curricular activities where students not only enhance their skills and competencies but also promote community life around the region. These student associations organize activities ranging from seminars, debates, quizzes and symposia on events and issues of national and international importance to games, sports and cultural programmes. Additionally, these student associations also carry out community services in and around the Kanglung. While it is purely up to an individual student to become a member of any of the various clubs/units depending on their interest, they must know how to balance academic performance and co-curricular activities. Therefore, it is encouraged that a student becomes a member of a maximum of only 2 clubs/units.</p>
        <p class="sub-title">Forum for International and National Awareness (FINA)</p>
        <p>The Forum for International & National Awareness (FINA) is the most important and the largest student body in the College. All regular registered students of the College are members of FINA. All other student organizations function under the purview of FINA. The forum reports directly to the College Management. The forum organizes all the important events and activities of the College in conjunction with the College management. Usual activities organized by FINA are seminars, debates, quizzes, and symposia on events and issues of national and international importance.  It also facilitates the organization of the inter-residence hall music  and games competition and various cultural programmes in the College.</p>
        <p>FINA has a student President, elected by the student body, a Vice President, two Secretaries, and two first-year representatives.  Leaders of other clubs, units, forums and societies become members of the FINA executive led by the FINA President. The College President is the Patron of the forum and the Dean of Student Affairs is the Staff Moderator.</p>
